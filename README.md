# 🎬 Netflix Movies & TV Shows Clustering  

“Performed clustering on Netflix movies and TV shows dataset to identify content patterns and group similar titles. Applied unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) for content segmentation. Generated insights on genre distribution, release trends, and content similarity to support recommendation strategies.”

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to cluster Netflix movies and TV shows based on attributes such as genre, release year, duration, and ratings. The goal is to uncover content patterns, group similar titles, and generate insights to support recommendation strategies.
